# Dungeon Crawler Game

This is a Dungeon Crawler game created with **C++**, which was assigned as my last programming assignment in COP 3330 at FSU, which I also took some inspiration from Path of Exile for the UI design. It makes use of the user's time to randomly generated 2 levels that the player can travel back and forth from. Each level will have 4 tiles that the user can move and interact with: M, R, T, and S, which are associated with the monster, trap, treasure, and stair tiles respectively. The program also makes use of inheritance and dynamic memory allocation to be as stable and resource-friendly as possible.

## Features

- Turn-based combat system
- Two procedurally-generated levels
- Trap that can reward or punish players
- Treasure chests
- Monsters and gold counters
- Optimized memory usage
